This is my first game developed in python. Known as 358 or as sergeant major. 
It contains:
1. Simple AI based on if statements
2. Can be played by one player or three bots
3. Cards work as drag & drop - can be moved into allowed space
4. Player card sorting
5. Cards validation - only allowed cards can be moved into game space
6. Game logic divided into game states
7. Simple gui helpers
8. Score board
9. Basic tests for AI
